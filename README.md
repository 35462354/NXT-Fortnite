**As the name states, Old NXT source; Custox made the source (from what I'VE been told). Outdated as of now, but easily updatable...Really only posting because there's some nice functions there.**

How to update (what I did)

D3DMatrix was giving me errors so I removed them and then copied the one from nuclear then pasted it where needed. All the sigs are wrong so update those, and discordhook then it injected..
